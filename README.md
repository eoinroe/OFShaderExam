# OF-Shader-Exam
openFrameworks port of leon196's Shader Exam

This example includes some of the shaders from this Unity project - https://github.com/leon196/SIGExam, as well as a few other
useful things such as how to render a depth texture and some simple lighting techniques.

Remember to include ofxGui if you are building this with the Project Generator!
